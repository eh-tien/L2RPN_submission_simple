This repository is designed to minimise the amount of time needed to create a working agent for the L2RPN challenge. 
---------------------------
This README is designed to walk through the process.


# **The first two steps deal with necessary installations, most users can skip these steps.**
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
## A. Jupyter Notebook installation
Please install Jupyter Notebook in order to use the `.ipynb` file which is the file that will create the model.
In order to do this, you must have Python installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/) so that you can install Jupyter.
For Mac/Linux and Windows, the installation is the same. Simply go to either the terminal or command prompt and enter `pip install notebook`.

## B. Git installation
In order to clone the repository (recommended), you will need to install Git. This can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads. After this, you should have `git` commands available to you.

## 1. Downloading the repository
### 1.1 Cloning the repository (Recommended)
In order to clone the repository, navigate to the top of the repository and click the green code button as seen below. <br />

<br />
This will copy the HTTPS link to the repository. You will need to paste this later.

Now, open up the Terminal (if you're on Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (if you're on Windows).
For ease of access to the file, change your working directory to wherever is convenient to store the repository.
For demonstration, I will change my working directory to 'Desktop'.<br /> 

**THE FOLLOWING CODE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPECIFIC USER AND MUST BE ENTERED BY YOU PERSONALLY.**

**Mac/Linux**: 
* `cd /Users/USER/Desktop`

**Windows**: 
* `cd \Users\USER\Desktop`

Now that you are in your preferred directory, enter `git clone` followed by the paste of what you copied above. It should look like this: <br />
`git clone https://github.com/eh-tien/L2RPN_submission_simple.git` <br />
If you didn't get this it is not a problem, simply copy the above line of code into Terminal / Command Prompt.

This should start a download and create the repository locally in your designated directory.

### 1.2 Downloading the .zip file
In order to clone the repository, navigate to the top of the repository and click the green code button as seen below. <br />
