This repository is designed to minimise the amount of time needed to create a working agent for the L2RPN challenge. 
---------------------------
This README is designed to walk through the process.


## **The first two steps deal with necessary installations, most users can skip these steps.**

# A. Jupyter Notebook installation
Please install Jupyter Notebook in order to use the `.ipynb` file which is the file that will create the model.
In order to do this, you must have Python installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/) so that you can install Jupyter.
For Mac/Linux and Windows, the installation is the same. Simply go to either the terminal or command prompt and enter `pip install notebook`.

# B. Git installation
In order to clone the repository (recommended), you will need to install Git. This can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads. After this, you should have `git` commands available to you.
