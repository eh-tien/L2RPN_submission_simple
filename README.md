This repository is designed to minimise the amount of time needed to create a working agent for the L2RPN challenge. 

This README is designed to walk through the process.

Steps:
The first two steps deal with necessary installations, most users can skip these steps.

# 1. Jupyter Notebook installation
Please install Jupyter Notebook in order to use the `.ipynb` file which is the file that will create the model.
In order to do this, you must have Python installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/) so that you can install Jupyter.
For Mac/Linux and Windows, the installation is the same. Simply go to either the terminal or command prompt and enter `pip install notebook`.

# 2. Git installation
